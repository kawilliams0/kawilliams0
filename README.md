🌐 I live in four parallel windows of creation.

🛠️ Developer → Crafting code, weaving logic, and bringing ideas to life.

🧪 Tester → Stress-testing systems, breaking them on purpose, so they come back stronger.

🕶️ Hacker → Thinking like the enemy, securing every crack before it becomes a threat.

🤖 AI Explorer → Training machines to learn, adapt, and amplify human potential.
